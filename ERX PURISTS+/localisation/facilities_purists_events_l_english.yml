With tensions rising and the NCR looming as a potential threat, President Anderson orders the reclamation of key outposts near Sierra Army Depo. The operation aims to expand the Enclave’s logistical network, secure pre-War technology, and establish additional forward bases for a coming war. "

purists_enclave_facilities.2.d: "Ever since we’ve reestablished ourselves in the SAD and restarted our crusade against the mutants, the depot had been a mix of military, science and governmental use. However, due to how reconstruction efforts and establishing Navarro as the capital, we’ve been slowly moving out everything related to governmental work and shipping it off to Navarro. With spaces freed up by moving out the furniture of politicians and conference rooms meant for the President’s advisors, new armories, barracks and storage have popped up.\n\nWhile sad that the average soldier will be able to see the president less frequently, it does ensure that if the base ever did fall it wouldn’t also ensure that the government falls as well.\n\nWith the SAD being fully restored to be used for military matters, it has made much of the higher ranking officers happy to not have to argue with politicians constantly while going about their business. One thing that we have restored with the moving out of pieces of government from the SAD was the ZAX unit, with Lieutenant Orwich making sure that the AI was loyal to the Enclave and didn’t pose any threat."

purists_enclave_facilities.3.d: "Before the Great War, America had many enemies, whether those be the commies over the pacific, the traitors in the states or its former allies, but the enemy that few knew about was not one on the earth, but in the stars. We knew about the zetans for awhile, having kept an eye on any activity that could be related to them and we even have some corpses and equipment of theirs. With this knowledge, we made preparations since our old plan was to head to the stars. One of those preparations was Site-28, or what it was commonly referred to before the war, ‘Fortress Enclave’ or ‘Enclave Fortress,’ a massive mountain complex built in the side of a mountain.\n\nThe main purpose of the facility was to keep an eye on anything extraterrestrial and to teach them that Earth isn’t for the taking, with the Fortress having 3 complete ZAX units to help coordinate and track anything suspicious. Along with the ZAX were large amount of robotic units and Special Forces units, with the leader of the base being General Tower. However the funding for the base was cut due to focus on Control Station Enclave, with many of the researchers and special forces units being sent to the Rig instead of the fortress.\n\nWhen the Great War started and we headed to all our bunkers, Site-28 was far from complete, but it still had to do its job. After a few years though, connection was lost to the site and all hands were deemed loss along with the installation. That was until we received a signal from them a few days ago..."

purists_enclave_facilities.4.d: "Apparently Site-28 never fell, and instead thrived into the fortress it was meant to be. Under the command of General Towers and the 3 ZAX units, they continued their mission of keeping an eye on anything extraterrestrial along with anything that could be deemed a threat to humanity. Over the years they eliminated small Zetan crafts along with their search parties, killed creatures that could not be explained by science and finally remained in contact with our satellites that remained after the great war. However they did have to break the rules at certain points by using wastelanders to report extra terrestrial activity, though with what they have done for not only america but humanity in general, we can turn a blind eye to that.\n\nWhat was more shocking was that most of the bases garrison were still alive, even General Tower. Though instead of the normal means of immortality we’ve seen, the human elements were mostly kept frozen until needed while the robots kept the fortress secured and only woke up the human elements to be sent on missions. When our delegation arrived to the Fortress they had been provided with numerous mission reports that showed the effectiveness and dedication to the mission originally given to Site-28.Most missions were successes, with the failures meaning that they had completed the mission but had to sacrifice a few members. There were only two complete failures, though they were labeled as ‘Utter Embassaments,’ one was at a small town in Montana and the other was in...Tokyo? The reports didn’t say what they fought at those locations, only that the teams sent in for embarrassed at what they lost too and didn’t want to talk about it. Ignoring those two, plus the fact they reached over to the pacific, they had a spotless record.\n\nThe garrison and leadership there is eager to rejoin the fight for America..."

purists_enclave_facilities.5.d: "Meeting with General Tower and the higher ups at Enclave Fortress, discussion of them rejoining us in our mission for the reclamation of America was heated, since they still wanted to continue their mission. So a deal was struck where Henry Miller will be placed in charge of the base alongside General Tower and his command squad, they get to keep their purpose while we still have some oversight over them. Along with the personnel and base also came tons of experimental equipment and studies by the ZAX units at Enclave Fortress. The main item being the Colossus Armor System, based on prototypes of the Hermes Armor, it offers extreme customizability to our special forces units not in power armor.\n\nThe base will also be used as a site to station Enclave SIGMA and other special forces units, since over the years the base has sprawled into a massive complex filled with barracks, foundries, research labs and other rooms that were used to help them fight against the alien and prepare humanity for when the zetans came in force. Most of the base was organized and built by the ZAX units, hence why some facilities are placed strangely compared to others.\n\nOn the topic of the ZAXs, unlike many of their brethren in the other parts of America they haven’t gone insane or became self-aware. They have stayed loyal to their programming and masters, meaning we can actually utilize them without having to reprogram or reconstruct them. \n\nWith the experience of the garrison, technology and the base itself, it has boosted our power significantly in both manpower and tech."

purists_enclave_facilities.6.d: "When we returned to Bloomfield we had expected that The Legion would have utterly torn apart everything there was at the place to fuel their war machine. What we found was that outside of some of the buildings used as barracks and the usual signs of the barbarians, the place was intact and could be restored faster than expected. The place was still a mess, corpses laid about and buildings were damaged when our forces arrived and engaged the Legion Forces there, though thankfully the Legion retreated fairly quickly, most likely seeing the place not worth dying for.\n\nNow while we may not be heading to space in mass  anytime soon, the Department of War has taken to use Bloomfield as what it was originally meant to do, an Air Base. The Army Corps of Engineers quickly got to work on repairing the runways and hangers whilst The Science Division got to work on repairing one of the B.O.M.B.’s that was left at the base and wasn’t put in orbit after the Great War.\n\nFor many in the wasteland it was impossible to build a strong airforce, but having assets in space? It was something few thought about since no one would have the capabilities for such a thing. Except for us, we can gladly reach to the stars and use it to reclaim America. Bloomfield is already being made into full operational airbase and a base to launch space stations into orbit."

purists_enclave_facilities.7.d: "Miller looked over the many schematics that the Science Division had salvaged from both Area 51, Bloomfield, Repconn facilities and old drafts made by scientists when bored at Navarro that had survived all the years. Many were simply satellites whilst others were more ambitious (The A.R.K. Colony schematics were definitely something he would be keeping to himself) but the current one he was viewing over was a recent design drafted by the Science Division. Bloomfield was taken back recently and Miller knew that anything space related to him would be under his command.\n\nThe current schematic was the B.O.M.B. MKII, it was essentially the same as the original, but having a more conventional weapons system and the ability to drop supplies thanks to pods right onto Enclave troops. Since it was the same, they could easily reuse the The B.O.M.B. that was at Bloomfield, fix it up and then launch it into space, not only would it be a benefit for the Enclave, but also a benefit for him, since he could leverage tech like it to help boost his support to going into space.\n\nBut that was for a later time, currently he had to make sure that everything went right with the MKII and that it actually got results. If it didn’t than there goes his chance for gaining support for his space projects. The B.O.M.B. MKII will be successful, it had too..."

purists_enclave_facilities.8.d: "Sergeant Stacker pressed himself against a massive boulder as weapon fire flew past him, he and his men had jumped right on top of a massive legion camp, and while they were practically invincible from whatever the savages threw at them, their ammo was running low and neither vertibirds or teleportation could get them ammo delivered to them. As he fired the last rounds from his plasma pistol he quickly holstered before taking out a Ripper and stabbing a savage that tried to ambush him.\n\n“If you have to, grab some of the savages weapons!” Stacker yelled over comms as he and his me continued to fight on, that is until command asked him for coordinates. While he wondered why, he wasn’t exactly in the position to question when a hoard of savages was clawing at them. With a harsh yell he gave them coordinates and went back to making sure that every mutant savage here knew what they were fighting.\n\nThat was until everything stopped, the sound of thunder catching everyone off guard and temporally stopping the battle as everyone wonder what in the world was happening, it was a bright sunny day, not a court insight. Then, all of the sudden, missiles slammed into the Legion forces and all around him and his squad. Bodies and debris were thrown into the air as he and his squad ducked behind anything they could find. After a minute, everything stopped and they all slowly stood up before looking around, confused at what had just happened before comms opened up..."

purists_enclave_facilities.9.d: "When our forces started to enter the Mojave, we started to receive transmissions from somewhere using Enclave codes. Vertibirds flew around the Mojave while ground troops sweeped the area until we had come in contact with...another Enclave? Both sides confused and not knowing if they should trust each other, we quickly flew in some representatives and met with the other Enclave, who called themselves the Richardson Elite. After some quick research on what exactly that was lead us to find that they were a unit sent out under General Rowlandson to secure objectives in the Mojave.\n\nWhat was surprising is that Rowlandson was actually alive! He quickly requested a meeting with the President and after a quick flight under heavy surveillance, Anderson had arrived at the Colorado Bunker and met with the old General, bringing him up to speed on the Enclave’s current situation. After our explanation, he gave the rundown on his situation, including the fact he was at war with another Enclave cell in the Mojave. It was an Enclave Cell under one General Jamison, he and his men were some of the first flown out of Navarro when the NCR and BOS came to cut us down.\n\nSadly he had turned soft and took his men to build his own Enclave, one that aligned more with the traitorous view of Granite than Anderson. Anderson along with Rowlandson were quickly flown out of the Mojave as Enclave forces started to sweep the Mojave for Jamison and his traitorous ilk, with some signs being reported of figures in APA MKI being seen throughout the night. Whilst the hunt went on, The Army Corps of Engineers arrived at the Colorado Bunker and started to repair the place, whilst General Rowlandson and his forces did their best, they still lacked the proper tools to keep the bunker in perfect condition.\n\nHowever, we don’t have that issue. The bunker was quickly brought up to date by fixing the bunker, bringing in excess equipment from the SAD, Area 51 and Big MT to make sure that the base had been updated to the standard that Enclave facilities have now reached. The bunker was also expanded to fit additional troops to house the soldiers busy in hunting down the traitors. The members of the Richardson Elite had also been given upgraded equipment, had cybernetics installed in them along with the standard FEV shots to keep them in the best shape, with many wanting to be the ones to put down the traitors.\n\nIt shouldn’t take long before we uncovered the traitors, and once we did, they’ll feel the pain for betraying us..."

purists_enclave_facilities.10.d: "We found them, located in the northern parts of the Mojave we had found Jamison’s forces, who, after seeing our troops scour the Mojave, have fortified themselves and made sure that we would have to dig them out. Jamison’s forces had taken over The Henderson Bunker, one of the many fall back points established so that should the Oil Rig fall, the Enclave had somewhere to fall back too. Sadly it was tainted by traitors.\n\nTwo plans had been drawn up, one by the Robotic Corps and one by the Chemical Corps. The Robotic Corps have suggested bringing in the various Robo-Scorpion models along with Assaultrons equipped with stealth fields to sneak into the base and slowly take it over without the traitors knowing, with one of the assaultron’s carrying a virus that would allow us to easily take over the Bunker’s systems. The Chemical Corps’s plan involves having a few Sentinel AI sneak into the base wearing damaged APA MKI suits, with microphone’s installed into them allowing Enclave personnel to convince the traitors they were remnants that had found the base thanks to maps.\n\nOnce inside the machines would proceed to release The Cloud upon the traitors, killing or maiming all of them and giving us the simple task of airing out the place and repair anything damaged. Both plans had the risk of failure but even if they did fail damaged would still be done to the traitors and make an assault on the base easier.\n\nAll that’s left is for either plan to be approved and for it to be put in place..."

Slowly they snuck through the area, dodging traitor patrols and the occasional vertibird that didn’t belong to us. They’re eventually reached into one of the many ventilation shafts that reached outside of the rocky cliffs that the Henderson Bunker was built inside of. Breaking through they dropped into the Bunker and got to work.\n\nRobo-Scorpions hid in cramped spaces and stayed still while the Assaultrons snuck through the halls, reducing guards to plasma or slitting their necks while they slept. Eventually they reached to the command room of the Bunker and with the quick insertion of a holotape containing a virus made by Lieutenant Orwich. Once installed the virus got to work handing control over to Orwich. Turrets turned on their previous masters, rooms were cut off from their oxygen supply and the robots the place had were brought under direct control of the Lieutenant.\n\nMany were of the traitors were rounded up and arrested, and when those outside of the base tried to rush in to help, they found themselves outnumbered and out gunned by a hoard of robots and their own defenses.

Plus killing pure humans that were most likely lead astray by their traitorous commander may leave a bad taste in our soldiers mouths, even some of Jamison’s soldiers didn’t believe in his ideas and were simply there to follow his banner. So we were stuck in a bit of a pickle, that was until Colonel Wagner gave his two cents.Colonel Wagner was a firm believer that we needed more hands to take back America, and while he had some controversy around due to the integration of honorary humans into the Enclave, he did have a point and was doing it out of pure practicality instead of being a reformer. He has suggested that we bring in the surviving members of Jamison’s forces into the fold, believing they can work off their debts by fighting for the true Enclave once more. While many didn’t want to work with them, Colonel Wagner’s idea was backed by his supporters along with no other than General Song. He supported the idea and even encouraged it, since once the remaining of Jamison’s forces heard that General song walked among the living, they started to turn their tune.Thus Colonel Wagner and General Song got to work on the task of bringing them back into the Enclave’s fold. After rigorous training and indoctrination along with loyalty tests they have confirmed that the surviving Jamison forces are ready to be brought back into the Enclave fully.

Convinced the traitors let the suits inside so they could be further evaluated and brought into Jamison’s fold.

The Cloud spread through the bunker at a blistering speed as the Jamison Enclave was caught completely off guard by the toxin. There was nothing the traitors could do as The Cloud ate through any form of protection the traitors had, traitors dying in their protective gear and falling to ground while others were ate away by the toxin. The automated defenses did their best to take down the Sentinel suit but due to being robots they were able to take more damage than a normal human.\n\nThe outside forces soon took notice and tried rushing into the Bunker, only to be poisoned by The Cloud, Once taken care of, the sentinel suits began airing out the bunker, making the main force’s job much easier when it came to restoring the Bunker..."

A mix of the forces from The Colorado Bunker and our bases were set to be the garrison, to encourage cooperation between us and our long lost brothers and sisters.\n\nThe base’s main purpose was to help the Colorado Bunker keep peace in the Mojave Bunker along with securing the Vaults in the area. To help with this, the base had been given a supply of riot gear, HCTSs and FEV troopers. It would also serve as a supply point for our troops once we start marching into Arizona. The base also had connections to other smaller outposts in the region, which after dealing with the traitors located at them, were subsequently captured and garrisoned by the Richardson Elite.\n\nWith the bases secure, we can start securing the Mojave faster than ever along with being able to enforce our laws on the mutants in the area..."

They had lasted a long, long time in the wastes, and lasted long enough to meet us.\n\nWhile their tech was impressive, they weren’t able to replicate them on a massive scale and as we pushed through their territory, they quickly fell back to their base of operations, and after an extensive siege and the use of slaves armed with bomb collars rushing in to blow up the cultists, the base was ours. Entering the base one could see how trashed it was due to our attacks along with the cultists paraphernalia about worshipping technology.

But eventually the facility was brought back to working order, with some of the excess garrison at the SAD being sent to fill the base.

Of course, one of our great strengths is our knowledge of automated warfare, why risk a human life on a mission when a robot just made a few days ago could complete it as well.

Though of course the issue with this is that robots take resources to produce and without proper facilities it takes time to make a robot division on par with human ones.\n\nEnter Safe Springs, an old Robco factory that borders us, the robots had seemingly built a self sufficient nation that defends the mutants there. They were quite accepting to new comers and robots looking for refuge, and that’s where they made a big mistake. After some planning and days of recon, Lieutenant Orwich alongside some protectrons we could spare infiltrated the nation, easily being allowed inside. Slowly they made their way across the land until arriving at the factory, holotape in hand. Once inside the Lieutenant had a minute until the AI in charge detected them and declared them as hostiles.

The mutants under the robots protection did try and fight back against us, but being outnumbered by their former protectors and outgunned by us, they had no choice but to kneel.

One of those magic bullets was stored at Iron Mountain on the west coast, which doubled as an Advanced Medical Facility based on improving humanity without FEV and research on unexplained creatures found before the war, though there weren’t really many of those outside of the Zetans and most of those were sent to Area 51. When the war began we kept in contact with Iron Mountain before it strangely went silent, what’s worse is that we lost its location, we only know it’s on the west coast. If we had known where it was we may have searched for it earlier, it may have even been where we went after the Rig went up in flames.\n\nMost thought its location was lost to time, and that it wouldn’t be cost effective to hunt down the old facility. But out of the blue, General Tower and the 3 ZAXs at Enclave Fortress just gave us the location of it, apparently they had never lost contact with the facility and had sent some aliens over to it for study, though they did lose contact with the facility somewhat recently and had tried to contain what escaped(Apparently it was whatever caused them to head to Tokyo.) After hearing that, we immediately sent in our forces to secure the facility to try and figure out what had happened there.\n\nArriving at the mountain facility we were met with what remained of the facilities automated defenses that, after showing our codes, allowed us inside to investigate the facility. The place had been trashed, signs of energy weapon fire and bodies in Hazmat suits along with remnants of sentry bots littered the halls, whatever had escaped did not like being contained. After the facility was secured the Army Corps of Engineers along with The Science Division made landfall at the facility to not only repair but improve the facility.
