purists_ead_vengeance.1.t: "The Chosen One the horizon."
purists_ead_vengeance.1.d: "Mr. President, as you know, our reconnaissance units have long been watching that backward place that the savages call Arroyo. In itself, it has no strategic value, but you, like all patriots of this country, know what kind of scum lives there. Quite recently, our main forces have already come close to the borders of this wretched tribe of savages. \n\n Only your order is needed, sir."
purists_ead_vengeance.1.a: "Show them no mercy!"
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.2.t: "The bastard is dead."
purists_ead_vengeance.2.d: "The news that the so-called 'Chosen One' was dead, along with his entire legacy, touched the hearts of all Enclave patriots. No one had forgotten that it was this mutant bastard who caused the death of so many people. And now that he is dead, their victims have been avenged. \n\n May he suffer forever in hell, while knowing, that he has failed!"
purists_ead_vengeance.2.a: "That is a fate of all mutants."
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.3.t: "Shady Sands Massacre."
purists_ead_vengeance.3.d: "Shady Sands.\n\n The capital of the NCR.\n\n Many of us have been waiting for this filthy place to fall beneath us. Many of us have lost our loved ones and relatives to the bastards who sit there. And now, retribution has come. \n\n After the Enclave troops finally broke the resistance of the local mutant garrison, our valiant commanders gave the only correct order. \n\n Kill them. \n\n Kill them all. \n\n For several days, Shady Sands became the site of a valiant and righteous massacre. True patriots spared no one. \n\n No one escaped."
purists_ead_vengeance.3.a: "Vengeance has come"
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.4.t: "The Fate of Hub."
purists_ead_vengeance.4.d: "Unlike Shady Sands, which the Enclave forces have a special fondness for, the Hub is not such a place.\n\n Yes, it is populated by the mutants we hate and is the economic center of the NCR, but over the years of the current administration, we have conducted some of our business through this place. \n\n Most of the officers believe that this place should be subjected to the same purge, however, there is a small opinion to use the Hub for its intended purpose, removing the filthy mutants, of course. \n\n It is up to you, Mr. President."
purists_ead_vengeance.4.a: "No mercy."
purists_ead_vengeance.4.b: "Perhaps we can find a use for these dirty mutants."
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.5.t: "The Fate of Boneyard."
purists_ead_vengeance.5.d: "Boneyard. Former Los Angeles. \n\n There are videos and recordings in the archives of how beautiful this place was before the war, and that's what makes it so painful to see what the NCR mutants have turned this place into. \n\n Even though there is talk of rebuilding this city, the mutant problem hasn't gone away. Most of the Enclave officials agree that the city needs to be cleansed of mutant filth, but, Mr. President, there is a small opinion that the local population can be used for construction purposes. After all, considering that we now control the coast, we need a navy."
purists_ead_vengeance.5.a: "Kill them all."
purists_ead_vengeance.5.b: "Perhaps we can find a use for these dirty mutants."
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.6.t: "The Fate of Greater Dayglow."
purists_ead_vengeance.6.d: "The portion of former Los Angeles called the Great Glow has come under our control relatively recently. The place is of no particular importance other than its population, which must be dealt with. \n\n Use standard procedures, Mr. Anderson?"
purists_ead_vengeance.6.a: "Yes."
purists_ead_vengeance.6.b: "We need extra slaves. Put them to work."
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.7.t: "The Fate of Brotherhood."
purists_ead_vengeance.7.d: "The Brotherhood of Steel has been a thorn in our side for many years. They, along with the NCR, participated in the devastation of Navarro, where many patriots died. It was their punitive squads that sought out survivors and mercilessly finished them off. \n\n The Brotherhood knew their fate very well. They were all traitors. And yet, they fought to the end, forcing the Enclave to pay a heavy price for victory. Not many tried to surrender. \n\n And now the question of their fate arises.\n\n Most of the administration demands public executions and bloody spectacles. But there are also small pragmatists who offer other solutions. Unlike most other mutants, members of the Brotherhood of Steel are the healthiest and most physically developed. We can use their labor force for many of our projects, including research. \n\n But there is one madman who has gone even further. Colonel Wagner, having spoken to some of the prisoners, assures us in all seriousness that there will be those among them who are ready to join us. But, Mr. President, you yourself understand what this means for us."
purists_ead_vengeance.7.a: "Kill them all."
purists_ead_vengeance.7.b: "They would be a fine slaves."
purists_ead_vengeance.7.c: "Perhaps Wagner is right."

purists_ead_vengeance.8.t: "The Fate of the Lost Hill."
purists_ead_vengeance.8.d: "Despite the fact that the Brotherhood of Steel are dirty traitors, we must admit the obvious - Lost Hill is a huge complex. \n\n Over the years of its existence, the Brotherhood of Steel has managed to expand a seemingly small bunker into an entire underground city that contains many secrets. Despite the fact that we plan to make it a prison for some surviving mutants who are of interest to us, this place still contains a huge amount of valuables. \n\n According to the original plan, we must completely clear this place, but after studying it properly, scientists and the military offer other options. \n\n The guys from Big MT suggest deploying a research complex there, aimed at studying all available information, while the army suggests deploying a military base, using prisoners as targets for shooting. \n\n The decision is yours, Mr. President."
purists_ead_vengeance.8.a: "Scrapp it."
purists_ead_vengeance.8.b: "Let scientists start studying their database."
purists_ead_vengeance.8.c: "Use it as a training camp."

purists_ead_vengeance.9.t: "Our finest hour."
purists_ead_vengeance.9.d: "Brotherhood. \n\n NCR. \n\n The Chosen One. \n\n All of them were responsible for the Control Station tragedy and the suffering that followed. And now they are gone. Only the remnants remain, hiding in caves, trembling in fear of our vertibirds. \n\n We won. \n\n We did the impossible and took back what was rightfully ours. \n\n No one will stop us anymore. Not Caesar's Legion. Not the remaining Brotherhood chapters. Not any other mutants. \n\n We will rule this country, or burn it to the ground."
purists_ead_vengeance.9.a: "God bless the Enclave."

purists_ead_vengeance.10.t: "The heads of the bear."
purists_ead_vengeance.10.d: "The NCR is dead, its armies crushed, its population cowering in fear to us. The mutants finally know what it felt to be us, to be hunted, shunned from the sun and killed without mercy. They know our pain, and they will continue to know it until every single one of them is buried.\n\n The first to be buried will be the bear’s leadership, whilst most were killed in our purge of Shady Sands, some still survived, and they had to be punished. President Tandi may not be alive to face punishment, but those that continued her policy will.\n\n Marching them through the deserts of California while recorded to be played on the TVs in mutant camps, many fell and were promptly killed by Military Police, and those who survived arrived to their resting place.\n\n The Glow. Enclave assaultrons dragged them towards the glowing pit of death, the radiation already eating at the NCR politicians as they were tossed into the pit, screaming all the way down until being silenced.\n\n Justice for so many humans killed, so many families lost, the Oil Rig, everyone we lost to that damn tribal and the NCR, avenged, Richardson and High Command had been finally avenged.  The Enclave had cut off the heads of the NCR just like the mutants attempted to cut of the Enclave’s head.\n\n Many more will know the same fate..."
purists_ead_vengeance.10.a: "Ultio Contra Ursum."

purists_ead_vengeance.11.t: "Fate of useful idiots."
purists_ead_vengeance.11.d: "Amidst the Enclave’s iron grip over the former NCR territories, the Sierra Enclave holds the fate of captured NCR remnants in its hands. With the NCR eradicated, the Enclave unleashes a brutal campaign of executions and war crimes to purge the wasteland of its enemies. Among some of the prisoners are NCR scientist, including both Edwin Royst and Lydia Bernard, two scientists who once served the NCR, having briefly crossed paths with Colonel Wagner during the conflict’s final days. Wagner, ever the pragmatist, proposes a contentious plan: there a few NCR scientist, that could match Enclave skills and working ethic. Why to put their talent to waste, when they could be used? He also suggest to use former Enclve members and their childrens, who went complete local. Under rightfull guidance and harsh work, their could again become a valuable members of the Enclave.\n\nThe proposal meets fierce resistance. Most Enclave officers, fueled by purist zeal and the bloodlust of victory, demand the immediate execution of all NCR remnants. The notion of sparing anyone, even those with Enclave blood, is seen as a dangerous compromise—penal battalions or not, they fear corruption within their ranks. The Enclave must decide: embrace Wagner’s utilitarian approach to bolster their scientific and military might, or uphold their merciless doctrine by purging every last vestige of the NCR."
purists_ead_vengeance.11.a: "No mercy."
purists_ead_vengeance.11.b: "Perhaps, this madman is right. We could use additional workers."
purists_ead_vengeance.11.b.tt: "Unlock both Bernard and Royst as theorists. Unlock Cryo-Troopers."

################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.12.t: "The Divide."
purists_ead_vengeance.12.d: "One of the many territories we conquered during the war with the NCR was the divide, Hell on earth as many call it due to the radiation storms, endless hoards of mutants and an unstable environment. When we arrived to reclaim Hopevill and Ashton we had to fight our way in. Not only were there plenty of mutants ready to tear our men’s throats out but also plenty NCR remnants ready to make their stand in The Divide. Weapon Fire echoed throughout The Divide for days on end, Deathclaw nests being destroyed by either airsupport or drones carrying heavy ordnance into them and detonating them while Enclave PA units traded laser fire with NCR troopers.\n\n Eventually though, The Divide fell silent as the final pieces of resistance were cleaned up and the Army Corps of Engineers moved in to try and reestablish many of the buildings in The Divide. Along with engineers came Regiments of Military Police to enforce Enclave control over the area along with making sure that the engineers weren’t attacked by any surviving mutants. Luckily many of the defenses in The Divide were restored and even the MPs were able to salvage the extensive amount of Riot Gear and IFVs to relieve the stress of logistics.\n\n It will take some time for the bases to be brought back online, but luckily we shouldn’t run into any new problems."
purists_ead_vengeance.12.a: "We made sure that everything was dead, right?"
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.13.t: "Below the Surface."
purists_ead_vengeance.13.d: "Apparently we didn’t kill everything because after a few days of rebuilding The Divide for our own uses our forces became under attack by strange mutants that we missed during our initial purge of The Divide. Strange reptilian creatures rose up to attack our forces and we quickly learned that they are a pain to put down, able to tank multiple hits and able to tear through our armor with ease. Eventually a quarantine zone was established as the wounded were quickly treated to by our doctors. Thankfully many was able to be rushed to nearby auto-docs, saving many lives.\n\n Along with him came The Chemical Corps, who immediately got to work coming up with a strategy on how to deal with the infestation of these creatures while aircraft flew constantly overhead of the Divide to keep an eye on the mutants. Though currently they’ve laced the perimeter of the infestation zone with sentry bots equipped with F.E.V. Throwers that easily clean the creatures out. We’ll keep tabs on the situation along with installing sensors around the ara to make sure that none of the creatures get through.\n\n We can’t risk losing The Divide to these monsters."
purists_ead_vengeance.13.a: "The Chemical Corps always prevail..."
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.14.t: "Way deeper down."
purists_ead_vengeance.14.d: "After two weeks of study, the Chemical Corps have come up with a plan that would risk zero human casualties! The first phase will be to send in sentry bots equipped with FEV throwers to draw out the creatures and allow robo-scorpions and wanamingos to go undetected by the creatures, with their objective to find the nests of these creatures and terminate them. The robo-scorpions have been modified with drills, heavier armor and FEV sprayers to make sure they arrive to their location, with the Wanamingos meant to take hits for them. \n\n Once the nests have been take out, FEV troopers in HCTSs will clean up the stragglers before the army corps of engineers can move back in and look over the damages that the creatures have caused. We’ve been assured that the job will get done much faster than relying on mutants or lobotomites to get it done.\n\n The plan will go into effect in a week, due to having to send in the supplies from Area 51 and the Big MT."
purists_ead_vengeance.14.a: "Those mutants won’t even know what hit em..."
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.15.t: "Robots and Mutants vs Mutants."
purists_ead_vengeance.15.d: "Success! The mutants were only weak to our weapons, they were completely caught off guard by our attack! Sentry bots tore through the mutants while underground our robotic and mutant forces hunted down the mutant’s nests with ruthless efficiency and sustaining very little damage. The Chemical Corps used eyebots to monitor the situation, even sending some of the footage over to Chicago to show that we know how clear out mutant nests! After four days, with the last day being spent by capturing the surviving creatures for our scientists to study. The Army Corps of Engineers have moved in and are already taking notes on what was damaged, what need complete replacement and what was fine.\n\n While our restoration efforts of Ashton and Hopevill have been delayed, the knowledge we have gained from The Divide and its creatures will help us incase we ever have to deal with underground creatures again..."
purists_ead_vengeance.15.a: "Science prevail!"
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.16.t: "New Divide."
purists_ead_vengeance.16.d: "The Divide was once a hellish landscape, mutants fighting mutants as the storms ate at anyone that entered without proper equipment, with monuments of the old world standing tall over the landscape. Now The Divide stands as a bastione of the Enclave’s might, the landscape now used as a defensive barrier that our forces easily negate thanks to vertibirds and teleportation. Ashton and Hopevill have been rebuilt and rearmed, extensive security measures litter the bases and everyone is ready to fight at a minute’s notice incase of a coordinated attack was to make their way to them.\n\n We’ve also been able to pick up on some of the research that our ancestors conducted here, better support weaponry for our standard infantry and heavier gear for our Military Police, which were heavily utilized in the fading days of the old world and in the immediate aftermath of the Great War. Though occasionally our forces spot a humanoid figure watching over The Divide, and any time we send teams in after it, it disappears without a trace."
purists_ead_vengeance.16.a: "It’s probably just the wind."

################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.17.t: "The Tunnelers"
purists_ead_vengeance.17.d: "The Tunnelers, the creatures that attacked us in the Divide have been studied heavily thanks to the ones that the Chemical Corps we able to capture. Our current guess is that they are mixture of humans and reptiles, most likely caused by both the radiation and FEV, since we did keep some FEV in the Divide during the pre-war days. Normally we would just take notes of these and go back to our lives but Chief Researcher Sierra has come up with the idea that we could use our stock of mutant slaves and create our own versions of the creatures for our own uses.\n\n After she proved they could be of use to us after demonstrating the captured one’s effectiveness against a group of legionaries that we captured trying to raid our territory, her idea was approved. Production of the Tunnelers have begun, though they require extensive training and require shock or explosive collars to be fitted against them just incase they try to attack us."
purists_ead_vengeance.17.a: "Death from below!"
purists_ead_vengeance.17.a.tt: "Unlock a war time decision to use tunnelers as a destructive force"

purists_ead_vengeance.18.t: "The Fate of Maxson."
purists_ead_vengeance.18.d: "Mr. President, with the capture of Maxson, we are faced with the standard question of the fate of this settlement. Most of our officers, considering that this place bearing name of you know how, are leaning toward standard procedures. Should we give an orider to Simmons?"
purists_ead_vengeance.18.a: "Simmons, do your job!"
purists_ead_vengeance.18.b: "Contact Callahan."

purists_ead_vengeance.19.t: "Erasing Maxson."
purists_ead_vengeance.19.d: "No not the traitorous bloodline created by Captain Maxson when he lead his troops into active rebellion at Mariposa, but the city of Maxson that the NCR named after him due to the Brotherhood’s efforts of helping the mutant bastards try and end the American dream. Though years later, when the NCR and brotherhood war kicked off, the place became source of tension between the two nations. Though of course none of that matters now, both have been crushed under us, and Maxson is left all alone. No mutant rangers or steel paladins guarded it, and what fire that town sent at us was pitiful. There was no discussion on what we were going to do to the town as our forces encircled it.\n\nEnclave Marshals along with Military Police and Secret Service entered the town with air and ground support, mutants hid in their homes as any that were left outside were gunned down by vertibirds flying over the city. For the ground forces, they kicked in each and every door to deliver justice for not only firing upon Government agents and troops, but also supplying the NCR and BOS during the war. Those that weren’t killed during the initial entry, were brought out and chained up by Military Police to be used in mass labor campaigns all across California. It took days and enough ammunition to bury a battle tank in, but justice had been delivered to the mutant traitors of the town.\n\nAs for the town itself, once it was all said and done, the place was in ruins thanks to constant house to house fighting. Thus, under the command of Special Agent Simmons, the town was set alight. The town burned bright enough that some would think that we created a mini-sun at Maxson. After days, the town was reduced to ashes, making it so that nothing remained of the Brotherhood in California..."

purists_ead_vengeance.21.t: "The Refuge of Steel."
purists_ead_vengeance.21.d: "Only miles off the coast of California laid the town of Maxson, named after the traitorous captain and founder of the terrorist cult that tried to end the American dream. Named in honor of Maxson by the NCR after the Brotherhood had helped them during the battle of Navarro, where Paladins and NCR soldiers fought side by side in their pursuit of ending America. The town over the years had grown peaceful despite the tension and eventual war between the Brotherhood and NCR. After the war the town had been watched over by both sides, making sure that it aligned with their respective side. That of course changed when we arrived and made sure that the only owners of it was us, even if we really didn’t want it.\n\nOur original plan was to lay waste to the city, delivering justice upon the mutants there and removing the trace of the Brotherhood from California. But thanks to us accepted the BOS into our ranks due to Colonel Wagner’s suggestion, we instead thought of a different use for the town. Due to most of our soldiers not wanting to live next to people that belonged to the cult that tried to end America and had a hand in the deaths of family members, the traitors didn’t really have a home in the Enclave, and we definitely weren’t letting them live near our citizens.\n\nThus Maxson was declared to be turned into the city where the Brotherhood members brought into the Enclave would live, breath and die. Over the coming days the town was uplifted to a beautiful city in a combined effort by the Army Corps of Engineers, surviving Brotherhood Knights and plenty of slaves that came from pure NCR cities. The city functioned as both the home of the Brotherhood but also the base of the Brotherhood, just so our prestigious officers don’t have to be near traitors, no matter how pure they were."
