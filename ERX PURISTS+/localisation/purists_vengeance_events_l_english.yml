purists_ead_vengeance.1.t: "The Chosen One the horizon."
purists_ead_vengeance.1.d: "Mr. President, as you know, our reconnaissance units have long been watching that backward place that the savages call Arroyo. In itself, it has no strategic value, but you, like all patriots of this country, know what kind of scum lives there. Quite recently, our main forces have already come close to the borders of this wretched tribe of savages. \n\n Only your order is needed, sir."
purists_ead_vengeance.1.a: "Show them no mercy!"
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_vengeance.2.t: "The bastard is dead."
purists_ead_vengeance.2.d: "The news that the so-called 'Chosen One' was dead, along with his entire legacy, touched the hearts of all Enclave patriots. No one had forgotten that it was this mutant bastard who caused the death of so many people. And now that he is dead, their victims have been avenged. \n\n May he suffer forever in hell, while knowing, that he has failed!"
purists_ead_vengeance.2.a: "That is a fate of all mutants."

purists_ead_vengeance.3.t: "Shady Sands Massacre."
purists_ead_vengeance.3.d: "Shady Sands.\n\n The capital of the NCR.\n\n Many of us have been waiting for this filthy place to fall beneath us. Many of us have lost our loved ones and relatives to the bastards who sit there. And now, retribution has come. \n\n After the Enclave troops finally broke the resistance of the local mutant garrison, our valiant commanders gave the only correct order. \n\n Kill them. \n\n Kill them all. \n\n For several days, Shady Sands became the site of a valiant and righteous massacre. True patriots spared no one. \n\n No one escaped."
purists_ead_vengeance.3.a: "Vengeance has come"

purists_ead_vengeance.4.t: "The Fate of Hub."
purists_ead_vengeance.4.d: "Unlike Shady Sands, which the Enclave forces have a special fondness for, the Hub is not such a place.\n\n Yes, it is populated by the mutants we hate and is the economic center of the NCR, but over the years of the current administration, we have conducted some of our business through this place. \n\n Most of the officers believe that this place should be subjected to the same purge, however, there is a small opinion to use the Hub for its intended purpose, removing the filthy mutants, of course. \n\n It is up to you, Mr. President."
purists_ead_vengeance.4.a: "No mercy."
purists_ead_vengeance.4.b: "Perhaps we can find a use for these dirty mutants."

purists_ead_vengeance.5.t: "The Fate of Boneyard."
purists_ead_vengeance.5.d: "Boneyard. Former Los Angeles. \n\n There are videos and recordings in the archives of how beautiful this place was before the war, and that's what makes it so painful to see what the NCR mutants have turned this place into. \n\n Even though there is talk of rebuilding this city, the mutant problem hasn't gone away. Most of the Enclave officials agree that the city needs to be cleansed of mutant filth, but, Mr. President, there is a small opinion that the local population can be used for construction purposes. After all, considering that we now control the coast, we need a navy."
purists_ead_vengeance.5.a: "Kill them all."
purists_ead_vengeance.5.b: "Perhaps we can find a use for these dirty mutants."

purists_ead_vengeance.6.t: "The Fate of Greater Dayglow."
purists_ead_vengeance.6.d: "The portion of former Los Angeles called the Great Glow has come under our control relatively recently. The place is of no particular importance other than its population, which must be dealt with. \n\n Use standard procedures, Mr. Anderson?"
purists_ead_vengeance.6.a: "Yes."
purists_ead_vengeance.6.b: "We need extra slaves. Put them to work."

purists_ead_vengeance.7.t: "The Fate of Brotherhood."
purists_ead_vengeance.7.d: "The Brotherhood of Steel has been a thorn in our side for many years. They, along with the NCR, participated in the devastation of Navarro, where many patriots died. It was their punitive squads that sought out survivors and mercilessly finished them off. \n\n The Brotherhood knew their fate very well. They were all traitors. And yet, they fought to the end, forcing the Enclave to pay a heavy price for victory. Not many tried to surrender. \n\n And now the question of their fate arises.\n\n Most of the administration demands public executions and bloody spectacles. But there are also small pragmatists who offer other solutions. Unlike most other mutants, members of the Brotherhood of Steel are the healthiest and most physically developed. We can use their labor force for many of our projects, including research. \n\n But there is one madman who has gone even further. Colonel Wagner, having spoken to some of the prisoners, assures us in all seriousness that there will be those among them who are ready to join us. But, Mr. President, you yourself understand what this means for us."
purists_ead_vengeance.7.a: "Kill them all."
purists_ead_vengeance.7.b: "They would be a fine slaves."
purists_ead_vengeance.7.c: "Perhaps Wagner is right."

purists_ead_vengeance.8.t: "The Fate of the Lost Hill."
purists_ead_vengeance.8.d: "Despite the fact that the Brotherhood of Steel are dirty traitors, we must admit the obvious - Lost Hill is a huge complex. \n\n Over the years of its existence, the Brotherhood of Steel has managed to expand a seemingly small bunker into an entire underground city that contains many secrets. Despite the fact that we plan to make it a prison for some surviving mutants who are of interest to us, this place still contains a huge amount of valuables. \n\n According to the original plan, we must completely clear this place, but after studying it properly, scientists and the military offer other options. \n\n The guys from Big MT suggest deploying a research complex there, aimed at studying all available information, while the army suggests deploying a military base, using prisoners as targets for shooting. \n\n The decision is yours, Mr. President."
purists_ead_vengeance.8.a: "Scrapp it."
purists_ead_vengeance.8.b: "Let scientists start studying their database."
purists_ead_vengeance.8.c: "Use it as a training camp."

purists_ead_vengeance.9.t: "Our finest hour."
purists_ead_vengeance.9.d: "Brotherhood. \n\n NCR. \n\n The Chosen One. \n\n All of them were responsible for the Control Station tragedy and the suffering that followed. And now they are gone. Only the remnants remain, hiding in caves, trembling in fear of our vertibirds. \n\n We won. \n\n We did the impossible and took back what was rightfully ours. \n\n No one will stop us anymore. Not Caesar's Legion. Not the remaining Brotherhood chapters. Not any other mutants. \n\n We will rule this country, or burn it to the ground."
purists_ead_vengeance.9.a: "God bless the Enclave."
