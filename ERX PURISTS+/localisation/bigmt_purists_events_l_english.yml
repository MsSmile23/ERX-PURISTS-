purists_ead_bigmt.1.t: "A WHAT and HOW!?"
purists_ead_bigmt.1.d: "The Big MT contains many strange things, that we knew. But what our eyebots found before being destroyed was even stranger. Whilst searching our eyebots found a cave that had a few bloat flies, nothing too strong.\n\nThen they were quickly taken out by one that seeming fired plasma. In response we sent in a group of sentry bots and too our surprise, they did nothing to the blowfly as it easily tore through them. Somehow this random creature was able to worked the same power as some of the strongest Deathclaws.\n\nAgain and again anything our garrison at the Big MT threw at that bloatfly just died, so finally a Sigma team was sent in with some of the heaviest ordnance they could carry that wouldn’t cause the cave to collapse in on itself. With stealtboys the team opened fire on the creature before it knew they were there.\n\nIn a long and drawn out firefight that saw multiple members of the squad wounded, the bloatfly was killed, exploding like a plasma grenade. When researchers were called in, they found that thing had tons of chems on it!\n\n We’re not even sure where to begin, and the Science Division isn’t sure how something like it could happen…"

purists_ead_bigmt.2.t: "The Maz Hatters"
purists_ead_bigmt.2.d: "The wasteland is filled with danger, whether that be a Deathclaw ready to rip you apart or massive lakes of radiation. Maybe both concerning the mutant species of ghouls. Unlike most nations in the wasteland, we have access to hazmat suits that are able to withstand the fallout of the Great War.\n\nBut what if they were something more? Well, Big MT had the answer in hazmat technology to make sure that not even the deadliest of chemicals can hurt our researchers or those employed in the Chemical Corps.\n\nOriginally meant to deal with The Cloud, the Darklight Hazmat Suits were experimental suits that never saw production, and while we aren’t going to mass produce them, we can combine them with our own hazmat suits and sets of Hermes armor to make the ultimate form of protection against the wastes.\n\n Less armored then a normal suit of Hermes, the Hansen Combat Toxin Suit(HCTS) provides everything we need for our researchers in the field and those using chemical weaponry. Mass production has begun to give out to FEV troopers and researchers that like to observe in the field."
purists_ead_bigmt.2.a: "A perfect suit for the Chemical Corps."
