purists_advisor.1.t: "Congratulations on your victory, Mr. President."
purists_advisor.1.d: "Mister Anderson, your victory is a tremendous success for the entire Enclave. However, you have always had loyal people along the way who, like you, want to avenge all the humiliations that true patriots have suffered since the destruction of the ENCLAVE Control Station. Are you willing to reward their loyalty, or would you rather take all the power for yourself?"
purists_advisor.1.a: "To my trusted advisors (unlocks additional content)."
purists_advisor.1.b: "I AM THE PRESIDENT."

purists_advisor.2.t: "Fate of the Vault-City leadership."
purists_advisor.2.d: "Mister Anderson, after you gave the order to spare the population of Vault City, we were faced with the obvious question of what to do with their leadership. Many of them have expressed a desire to cooperate with us, but... frankly, Mister President, many in our ranks will not be very happy to see these 'people' again. But, the call is yours."
purists_advisor.2.a: "Sure, but keep an eye on them."
purists_advisor.2.b: "They will do fine in janitor positions."
purists_advisor.2.c: "Its time for some public execution."
