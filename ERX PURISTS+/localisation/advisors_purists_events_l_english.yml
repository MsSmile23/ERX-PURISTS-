purists_advisor.1.t: "Congratulations on your victory, Mr. President."
purists_advisor.1.d: "Mister Anderson, your victory is a tremendous success for the entire Enclave. However, you have always had loyal people along the way who, like you, want to avenge all the humiliations that true patriots have suffered since the destruction of the ENCLAVE Control Station. Are you willing to reward their loyalty, or would you rather take all the power for yourself?"
purists_advisor.1.a: "To my trusted advisors."
purists_advisor.1.a.tt: "Unlock additional advisors."
purists_advisor.1.b: "I AM THE PRESIDENT."

purists_advisor.2.t: "Fate of the Vault-City leadership."
purists_advisor.2.d: "Mister Anderson, after you gave the order to spare the population of Vault City, we were faced with the obvious question of what to do with their leadership. Many of them have expressed a desire to cooperate with us, but... frankly, Mister President, many in our ranks will not be very happy to see these 'people' again. But, the call is yours."
purists_advisor.2.a: "Sure, but keep an eye on them."
purists_advisor.2.a.tt: "Some of the Vault-City leadership become available as advisors."
purists_advisor.2.b: "They will do fine in janitor positions."
purists_advisor.2.c: "Its time for some public execution."

purists_advisor.3.t: "A man from Texas."
purists_advisor.3.d: "Mr. President, after we managed to contact Colonel Houston, he sent us his best man - Colonel Holms. According to him, he is a real ace who will help us in the conquest of America and the speedy reunification in Texas."
purists_advisor.3.a: "His more than welcome."
purists_advisor.3.a.tt: "Support from Texas has arrived"

purists_advisor.4.t: "A helping hand from MacArthur."
purists_advisor.4.d: "Mr. President, after MacArthur Base came under our control, Colonel Santiago sent some of her men to help us. Their help in gathering resources and suppressing the savages will be more than enough, however, Agent Adams raises some questions. We know that he was born, raised, and until recently was in Chicago. There are some questions about his loyalty to our cause."
purists_advisor.4.a: "Watch them."
purists_advisor.4.a.tt: "Finally, MacArthur is doing something for us!"

purists_advisor.5.t: "Bending the rules."
purists_advisor.5.d: "President Anderson sat in his seat as he watched an aspiring Colonel give his plea about what should be done about Vault City. Multiple other high ranking officials listened intently to what the man had to say, he had marched into the conference room with multiple holotapes in his hand and Doctor Davidson behind him. His name was a Colonel Wagner, and he was one of the most pragmatic people in the Enclave...for the wrong reasons. He pleaded that the people of Vault city should not only be spared, but brought into the Enclave as ‘Honorary Humans,’ a tactic never done before by the Enclave. Not only the people of Vault City, but other places of they pass rigorous genetic and loyalty tests.\n\n“We have a continent to conquer, and it will take us years for us to build an army to just hold the Nevada Area, even if we use robots.” Colonel Wagner said as he looked around the room, “We don’t have the luxury of time. But by allowing Honorary humans in, we can field larger armies while still retaining purity and integrity.”\n\nSome leaned in whilst others like Special Agent Simmons reached for a plasma defender, “I’m not a reformer, By God I have a hate for Granite and his kin, but we need every hand we can get. I’m not saying to give a raider a plasma rifle, but those that are not only willing, but are able pass the tests, should be allowed to reclaim the continent. It’s better they die than any actual humans.” Everyone looked around while Anderson leaned over and passed the order to some officers. “When this is all over, when we’re comfortably sitting in DC, then we can get rid of these ‘Honorary Humans,’ but for now? Let them fight for the Enclave.”\n\nThe room was silent until Anderson stood and spoke."
purists_advisor.5.a: "Vault City shall be spared."
