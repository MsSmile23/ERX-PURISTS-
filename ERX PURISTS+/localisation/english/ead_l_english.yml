ead_slave_master: "Wastelander Slaver"
ead_slave_master_desc: "Senator Glenn Brown is a shrewd and morally flexible figure within the Sierra Enclave, renowned for his expertise in exploiting wasteland labor to fuel the Enclave’s ambitions.

His unapologetic pragmatism and knack for bending others to his will make him a powerful, if controversial, voice in the Enclave’s political hierarchy. Brown’s methods, though effective, sow fear and resentment, cementing his reputation as a man who gets results at any cost."

ead_lobotomite_production_expert: "Director of Lobotomite programm"
ead_lobotomite_production_expert_desc: "Eric Alexander is a brilliant yet ethically dubious military scientist who assumed control of the lobotomite program after the Enclave seized Big MT. Coldly analytical and driven by a zeal for advancing Enclave technology, Alexander refines the program by subjecting wastelanders to horrific neurological experiments, transforming them into obedient, mindless drones. His innovations enhance the Enclave’s labor and combat capabilities, but his ruthless methods spark unease even among his peers. Alexander’s unwavering commitment to scientific progress and Enclave supremacy makes him a pivotal, if unsettling, figure in Big MT’s dark legacy."

With dwindling supplies and mounting external threats, his leadership is the only thing standing between operational integrity and total collapse. Every day is a battle against time, sabotage, and the ever-looming specter of NCR forces closing in. Failure is not an option."

At Sierra, his return stirs mixed reactions—while some admire his combat prowess and dedication, others resent his past desertion, viewing him as a liability to the Enclave’s fragile unity."

With a twisted sense of duty, Simmons revels in enforcing the Enclave’s genetic purity standards, often employing brutal methods to eliminate those deemed unworthy. Her cold, calculating demeanor and penchant for inflicting suffering make her a terrifying presence, even among allies.
