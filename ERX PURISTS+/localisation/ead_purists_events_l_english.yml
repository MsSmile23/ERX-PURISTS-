purists_ead_bigmt.1.t: "A WHAT and HOW!?"
purists_ead_bigmt.1.d: "The Big MT contains many strange things, that we knew. But what our eyebots found before being destroyed was even stranger. Whilst searching our eyebots found a cave that had a few bloat flies, nothing too strong.\n\nThen they were quickly taken out by one that seeming fired plasma. In response we sent in a group of sentry bots and too our surprise, they did nothing to the blowfly as it easily tore through them. Somehow this random creature was able to worked the same power as some of the strongest Deathclaws.\n\nAgain and again anything our garrison at the Big MT threw at that bloatfly just died, so finally a Sigma team was sent in with some of the heaviest ordnance they could carry that wouldn’t cause the cave to collapse in on itself. With stealtboys the team opened fire on the creature before it knew they were there.\n\nIn a long and drawn out firefight that saw multiple members of the squad wounded, the bloatfly was killed, exploding like a plasma grenade. When researchers were called in, they found that thing had tons of chems on it!\n\n We’re not even sure where to begin, and the Science Division isn’t sure how something like it could happen..."
purists_ead_bigmt.1.a: "A Wild Wasteland..."

purists_ead_bigmt.2.t: "The Maz Hatters"
purists_ead_bigmt.2.d: "The wasteland is filled with danger, whether that be a Deathclaw ready to rip you apart or massive lakes of radiation. Maybe both concerning the mutant species of ghouls. Unlike most nations in the wasteland, we have access to hazmat suits that are able to withstand the fallout of the Great War.\n\nBut what if they were something more? Well, Big MT had the answer in hazmat technology to make sure that not even the deadliest of chemicals can hurt our researchers or those employed in the Chemical Corps.\n\nOriginally meant to deal with The Cloud, the Darklight Hazmat Suits were experimental suits that never saw production, and while we aren’t going to mass produce them, we can combine them with our own hazmat suits and sets of Hermes armor to make the ultimate form of protection against the wastes.\n\n Less armored then a normal suit of Hermes, the Hansen Combat Toxin Suit(HCTS) provides everything we need for our researchers in the field and those using chemical weaponry. Mass production has begun to give out to FEV troopers and researchers that like to observe in the field."
purists_ead_bigmt.2.a: "A perfect suit for the Chemical Corps."
purists_ead_bigmt.2.a.tt: "Now, infantry requires support equipment."

purists_ead_bigmt.3.t: "Doctor Mobius!"
purists_ead_bigmt.3.d: "When we arrived to the Big MT, we had found that some of the scientists did survive the Great War, only to find out that every single one of them is insane. Along with insanity, they spouted that they were in a constant fight with another surviving scientist, Dr. Mobius.\n\n We’re unsure why he shares the name of a far off planet that many conspiracy theorists believed to exist (If it does than it’s probably where the Zetans came from.) but he appears to have retained most of his intelligence considering his creation of the robo-scorpions all around the Big MT.\n\n Efficient, heavy armor while still moving fast, and has more advanced laser weaponry along with the ability to borrow into the ground and ambush enemies. If we can get him to join us, it would benefit our robotics corp.\n\n We’ve dispatched Lieutenant Orwich along with two Sigma teams to investigate The Forbidden Zone Dome, with reinforcements at the ready just incase they encounter something like a giant robot.\n\n Considering how our attempts at that in the pre-war age went, we doubt he would have one of those."
purists_ead_bigmt.3.a: "He obviously can’t have one..."
################################################################################################################ -<
################################################################################################################ -<
purists_ead_bigmt.4.t: "I AM THE MOBIUS!"
purists_ead_bigmt.4.d: "He had a giant robot. Lieutenant Orwich along with the two Sigma teams immediately encountered a giant version of the robo-scorpions that inhabited the Big MT, and it was read for a fight. The two Sigma teams distracted the giant robot as Lieutenant Orwich tried to find some way to deactivate the scorpion.\n\n Of course our forces outside the dome were called in and soon not only helped the Sigma teams fend off the giant robo-scorpion but along with hoards of protectrons and robo-scorpions. Just as our forces began to be overwhelmed, Orwich had found a way to disable not only the Giant Robo-Scorpion, but all the robots in the area as well.\n\n Once the area was secured, casualties were counted and robots started to be dragged away for research and salvaging, with only one not being moved, that of course being the Giant Robo-Scorpion itself.\n\n It would have to be broken down into pieces or studied there, but they still have to deal the mad doctor..."
purists_ead_bigmt.4.a: "Checkmate, Doctor."

purists_ead_bigmt.5.t: "The Master Plan."
purists_ead_bigmt.5.d: "What remained of the two Sigma teams along with Orwich rushed into the room that held Doctor Mobius, weapons drawn they were ready to either bring Doctor Mobius in as a robot or as a jar. But instead of being attacked, they found that Doctor Mobius was simply confused about them.\n\n After discussing with the Doctor, it was revealed that all of his aggressive tendencies was because he was high on chems and trying to keep the other brains inside Big MT. Without the chems he was quite calm and cooperative with our forces.\n\n He even shut down all of his robots in the Big MT, making the troop’s job much less dangerous when it came patrolling the crater. With even further discussion, he was offered a position in the Enclave’s Science division.\n\n He accepted, and even gave us blue prints for all the types of Robo-Scorpions he had made or was planning to make. Meaning the Enclave now have a new weapon to wage war, and a scientist glad enough to make them."
purists_ead_bigmt.5.a: "Go forth, Robo-Scorpions!"
purists_ead_bigmt.5.a.tt: "Unlock Doctor Mobius as advisor, and a war time decision to unleash robo-scorpions on our enemies"

purists_ead_bigmt.6.t: "AI sitcom."
purists_ead_bigmt.6.d: "Our main base of operations in the Big MT was the Sink, a massive building that was basically intact when we arrived at the crater, and while establishing it as the HQ for the garrison there, researchers found that almost every appliance had some kind of holotape slot. Apparently they were for AI that would help the scientists around the sink.\n\n Soon enough Enclave soldiers were sent into places ranging from a strange cave with a toaster cult to a factory that held derange securitrons. Once all chips were gathered they were installed, and instead of advanced AI, it was Advanced AI that acted like people from a pre-war sitcom.\n\n Ranging from strangely seductive light switches to a respectable auto-doc, Enclave researchers were caught off by it all, but from the strangeness came opportunity! They could use the sink AI as basis for more advanced, and useful, AI!\n\n It will be a longtime since this will bear fruit, but it will benefit the Enclave in the long run! Advance AI that could run systems as advanced as a navy ship, or even help our troops in the field!\n\n The future is in the combination of man and machine!"
purists_ead_bigmt.6.a: "Can it be put in a power armor helmet?"
purists_ead_bigmt.6.a.tt: "Unlock desions to use Sink personalities to improve performance of our various branches"

purists_ead_bigmt.7.t: "The Z-43 Plant."
purists_ead_bigmt.7.d: "Chemical Warfare has always been a specialty of the Enclave, what better way to lay waste to an enemy with a numerical advantage but a technological disadvantage? Unleash some toxic gas on them and let it do the work.\n\n However, for our more advanced enemies, they would surely have the proper gear and equipment to fend off our normal toxins. Thus a new chemical weapon is needed to destroy the more advanced nations in our path.\n\n Enter the Z-43 innovative toxins plant, creation of The Cloud, a deadly toxin that can easily break through any defenses of our enemies, whether they be the lowest tribal to the mightiest paladin! Production has already been kicked into high gear of the weapon.\n\n Soon the wasteland will choke and die under the blood red cloud as our march to reclaim America is made significantly easier."
purists_ead_bigmt.7.a: "A New age of Chemical Warfare."
purists_ead_bigmt.7.a.tt: "Unlock a weaponised version of Red Cloud, which could be used in war time."

purists_ead_bigmt.8.t: "A New Age of transportation."
purists_ead_bigmt.8.d: "Moving across the wasteland is always a dangerous endeavor, even with our patrols and garrisons working overtime to make sure that no mutant rebels or animals get into our bases. Vehicle convoys risk being ambushed by animals or rebels and running fleets of vertibirds gets expensive.\n\n But like many things, Big MT had the answer for that, teleportation technology. After finding blue prints for transponders and a portable gun that would allow teleportation the Science Division got to work on making the technology wide spread enough.\n\n Of course tests had to be ran, first was on inanimate objects which worked well, then creatures which worked fine though some were confused, and next were humanoids. Of course we didn’t use humans so mutants worked well enough.\n\n The results were perfect!  The mutants came out fine only to be killed by our security forces, and with a test with a brave volunteer, it showed humans could teleport with ease! Meaning that our men and women no longer need to tread across a wasteland or fly high in a vertibird.\n\n This not only sees our transportation problems, but also logistics issues. A new age of transportation has begun!"
purists_ead_bigmt.8.a: "Teleporting straight to reclaiming America!"

purists_ead_bigmt.9.t: "Enclave Isolation."
purists_ead_bigmt.9.d: "A few of the creatures that roam the wasteland can be traced back to either us or the corporations of the old world(So us, again.) The Deathclaw being a pinnacle of creatures created by man to be used as weapons of war.\n\n However, there is a creature that was created by us to be a weapon but is actually no longer around, the wanamingo. This one was a much more recent creature though, one created when Richardson had just entered office.\n\n Using the few pieces of Zetan DNA, squid and multiple other animals, we created the perfect weapon! Well, just like Horrigan it appeared that the Chosen one also had a hand in their destruction as well.\n\n The west coast was free of them, but now we can bring the terror back! With the strands of Zetan DNA from Area 51, and the research in Big MT and even some isolated samples of the wanamingos from Chicago, we’ve been able to make an even stronger, more effective creature.\n\n While mass production won’t be achieved for awhile, even having the ability to produce puts us on the same ground as the bastards in Chicago..."
purists_ead_bigmt.9.a: "Did we incorporate the acid blood this time?"
purists_ead_bigmt.9.a.tt: "Unlock a war time decision to unleash hords of wanamingos upon dirty mutants"

purists_ead_bigmt.10.t: "Red Cloud Unleashed."
purists_ead_bigmt.10.d: "On today, the Sierra Enclave, under directive, deploys the weaponized SM-7 Red Cloud. A lethal bio-agent designed to eradicate mutant populations—in a calculated strike against a nearby mutant settlement. The crimson mist engulfs the area, swiftly annihilating super mutants, ghouls and other undersiable vermins, leaving nothing but desolation in its wake. While the Enclave celebrates this decisive blow, the repercussions are immediate: wasteland factions condemn the act, rallying survivors and fueling a unified resistance. Whispers of the Red Cloud’s potential to mutate further spread fear, threatening an uncontrollable escalation across the region."
purists_ead_bigmt.10.a: "We will endure."
purists_ead_bigmt.10.a.tt: "Everything has a price."

purists_ead_bigmt.11.t: "How I learned to love holograms."
purists_ead_bigmt.11.d: "One of the many things that were made at the Big MT were holograms, ones that could be weaponized to fight against the Chinese. Back then they were promising but inherently expensive and limited in their uses, but now we may have found a different use for them. The Robotics corp, specifically Lieutenant Orwich, have crafted a unique kind of sentry bot that, when in combat, projects multiple holographic Enclave soldiers to fight against its enemies, with it having the panels to do so all around its body. It does slow down while projecting the holograms due to the projectors eating up its power, a fair trade for additional fire power.\n\n However, The Line Corps and Science Division have come up with their own use for holograms in the field, all ordered by General Grimm due to wanting human soldiers to still be on the field. What they have come up with is a special type of grenade that when thrown, projects a hologram of a Enclave soldier that’s almost a one to one copy of a soldier, allowing it to soak up fire from the enemy. But it does not last long, only lasting around 30 seconds before going out due to limited power.\n\n Both sides have sent in pleas to try and get their project funded and mass produced. The Robotics Corps argues that it would help with their robots firepower and numbers along with making sure that less human lives are put at risk along with losing less materials since holograms don’t need repairing. The Line Corps argues that humans on the field can use the beacons to distract the enemy and give them enough time to tactfully withdraw or create a new plan to combat the enemy.\n\n Only one project can be funded and the choice has been put into your hands..."
