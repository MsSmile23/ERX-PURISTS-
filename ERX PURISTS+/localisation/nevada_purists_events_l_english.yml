purists_ead_nevada.1.t: "God’s Gonna Cut you down."
purists_ead_nevada.1.d: "When we arrived to the Esmeralda region, we found many places were littered with mutants in modified riot gear meant more for direct combat and energy weapons than it was for riot control. Apparently they belonged to the Rogue Rangers, a group of mutants that tried to emulate the Rangers of Pre-War America and were an off shoot of another group called the ‘Desert Rangers’, though looking through the records that we were able to find at was their base of operations, Hawthorne Army Depot, they were both founded by remnants of the 253rd Engineer Battalion of the Arizona National Guard. It explains why their fortifications and equipment was of higher quality than most in the wasteland, and most likely why they were able to get into Hawthorne.\n\nThough as our forces looked over Hawthorne, we had found a massive stockpile of the armor they commonly used, and after tests, we found that it was incredibly reliable and effective. It was also cheap to produce, and with some slight modifications, we were able to bring it up to our standards. Considering that taming the wastes is one of our big struggles ever since we took New Reno, officers have suggested building what would be the successor of both the United Stated Rangers and the United States Marshalls.\n\nThe Enclave Marshalls would both act as a military force and law enforcement, working Military Police units to enforce Enclave jurisdiction in the wasteland, carrying enough ordnance and able to tank the hits to properly enforce it. After some tests, the idea has beared fruit and starting mass production of the gear, it would allow our Military Police to work better..."

purists_ead_nevada.2.t: "Cutting down the Rangers."
purists_ead_nevada.2.d: "When we arrived to the Esmeralda region, we found that it had been taken over by a mutant group named the ‘Rogue Rangers.’ They had been able to take down both a tribal, a raider and a Brotherhood nation all on their own along with some sorta of robotic sitcom park. We had to give some props to the mutants, before putting them down of course and looking into just how they were able to do it. Outside of skill and all their enemies being busy, they had some outstanding equipment. Which made sense, they had access to Hawthorn Army Depot and after looking at their inventory documents, they were not only an old faction, but they were actually founded by remnants of the 253rd Engineer Battalion of the Arizona National Guard. \n\nThough as our forces looked over their many bases and outposts, we had found a massive stockpiles of the armor they commonly used a mixture of riot gear, dusters and combat armor., After numerous tests, we found that it was incredibly reliable and effective. It was also cheap to produce, and with some slight modifications, we were able to bring it up to our standards.

purists_ead_nevada.3.t: "The Abandoned Citadel."
purists_ead_nevada.3.d: "One of the many facilities lay in the sands of the Wasteland is Citadel AFB, a planned facility meant to house some of our forces when we would retake the mainland, however we didn’t taken into account that the personnel there that was planned to be rotated out heard the call of the traitorous Captain Maxson and had become cultists. They had lasted a long, long time in the wastes, and only now they had seemingly fallen to the other powers in Esmeralda. After arriving to the outskirts of the Air Base we found the place was utterly trashed, walls destroyed, air strips reduced to rubble, it would be a pain for us to shift through and repair.\n\nEntering the base it wasn’t any better, the place was not only trashed due to attacks, but by the cultists paraphernalia about worshipping technology. Massive pyres were built outside the base as the Army Corps of Engineers burned as much of the paraphernalia as possible, along with the bodies of the cultists and the bodies of the attackers. Once that was taken care of we started the long and painful process of making sure the base was even able to function. Slave labor from all over our territory were brought in to help the Army Corps of Engineers to actually get the job done in a short amount of time. Walls were reconstructed while new pavement was laid and entire new buildings were constructed to help house the engineers and robots, mutants don’t need sleep, they just need work.\n\nThe work continued slowly, many slaves dying to hidden traps and defenses inside the base along with executions to improve work efficiency amongst the slaves. But eventually the facility was brought back to working order, with some of the excess garrison at the SAD being sent to fill the base. Though with our current population, it will mostly be ran by robots and be under the command of the Robotic corps."

They had lasted a long, long time in the wastes, and lasted long enough to meet us.\n\nWhile their tech was impressive, they weren’t able to replicate them on a massive scale and as we pushed through their territory, they quickly fell back to their base of operations, and after an extensive siege and the use of slaves armed with bomb collars rushing in to blow up the cultists, the base was ours. Entering the base one could see how trashed it was due to our attacks along with the cultists paraphernalia about worshipping technology.

purists_ead_nevada.5.t: "Under the sands."
purists_ead_nevada.5.d: "One of the many points of interest in the Mojave for us was Hidden Valley, what most thought to be a valley filled with echoes of the Old World and the creatures of the new world, instead held a valuable secret. Under the sands was a massive bunker complex that was designed by the USAF before the Great War to act as a shelter for, who else, but us. But unlike many other bases all across North America that we inhabited, Hidden Valley was not one of them. We seemingly skipped over the place, not even leaving a token force at the bunker to keep it secure.\n\nThe place laid there, abandoned by us and left to the elements. But it wasn’t abandoned forever, and recently it had come under command of the Mojave Chapter of the traitors known as the Brotherhood of Steel. They had apparently taken command of the bunker complex to help support their activists in the region. Spreading their strange cultist idea across the bunker complex as their claws reached across the sands of the Mojave. However the Mojave Chapter was not meant to last, for when we arrived all we found was a bunker that acted more like a mass grave than a shelter.\n\nAfter burning the bodies in a nearby crater the Army Corps of Engineers were sent in and started getting to work on repairing and upgrading the bunker. Equipment all over the Enclave were brought in and an expansion to the bunker was made, having so that the complex covered Hidden Valley, allowing for more room when it came to the base’s garrison and robotic units. Along with the expansion came multiple hangers for vertibirds and garages for ground vehicles; with the ground vehicles being able to reach the surface thanks to large tunnels and lifts built around the area connecting to the complex.\n\nHidden Valley also connected to Nellis Air Force Base, making sure that it can easily contact additional air support when it came to reinforcing the Enclave’s law in the Mojave and deal with any rebels on the region. Mutants and creatures alike wouldn’t no what hit him when a massive force can rise up from the sands and catch them off guard at any time."

purists_ead_nevada.6.d: "One of the many points of interest in the Mojave for us was Hidden Valley, what most thought to be a valley filled with echoes of the Old World and the creatures of the new world, instead held a valuable secret.

Spreading their strange cultist idea across the bunker complex as their claws reached across the sands of the Mojave. When we arrived to the Mojave we found that Mojave Brotherhood wasn’t going to give up without a fight. Any BOS force that retreated after encountering us retreated to Hidden Valley, and once we had taken a majority of the Mojave, the Chapter’s forces were either dead or hiding inside Hidden Valley.\n\nThis of course makes our job easier, with their forces all in one place our troops quickly pushed into Hidden Valley, isolating each bunker and making sure which ones were empty and which held the BOS, once we did find the one we soon devised a plan on how to flood the traitors out. Thanks to the many vents that lead down into the bunker, we are given easy access to the ventilation system of the bunker. After a quick supply drop, our troops unleashed The Cloud into the bunker, and after the cloud they dropped in a few robo-scorpions with cameras transmitting to our teams outside.\n\nThe robo-scorpions crawled and snuck through the base as the toxin did its work, poisoning the traitors when they least expected it, they could do nothing as they slowly died inside their home. The only things that remained were the defense turrets that were easily dealt with by the robo-scorpions. Once it was ensured that the chapter was dead, our ground forces began dealing with the cloud with experimental cryo weaponry and making sure that when we occupied It we wouldn’t be killed by our own weapon. After burning the bodies in a nearby crater the Army Corps of Engineers were sent in and started getting to work on repairing and upgrading the bunker.

While this would bring even more cultists into our fold, having the intellect and skill along with just more bodies may help us in the long run. Of course our ground forces just suggest gassing the traitors and being done with these cultists."

purists_ead_nevada.8.t: "The Mojave Cultists."
purists_ead_nevada.8.d: "After flying in some of the BOS members from Lost Hills, they alongside multiple secret service agents along with SIGMA Blue, who were using stealth boys, entered the bunker and after speaking on the intercom outside the main door, they were allowed inside by the Mojave cultists and were soon brought to the Elder of the Chapter. We listened in on the conversations thanks to our personnel and slowly heard how the two sides of cultists argued about the situation. The Lost Hills personnel arguing that it was not only survival but also allows them to secure technology even better (In English terms worship technology.)\n\nThe Mojave cultists argued that when their worth ran out; we would just kill them unceremoniously. Which, we would since we don’t want to have cultists in our gene pool but we haven’t told them that one yet. The arguments dragged on for hours until finally the Mojave Elder caved, stepping down and allowing us to enter to the bunker without any trouble. We quickly started to confiscate anything we found and replacing key members of the Chapter with our own personnel we the Chapter’s personnel were taken to be ‘re-educated’ at Area 51, the children being taken to Vault 23 so they could be raised the right way, since they still fell in our purity rate. Of course some did have to be purged after they failed the genetic tests but once more the BOS shows that while they are cultists, they at least ensure they are ‘honorary’ humans.\n\nConsidering the fact that no damage was done to the base, the Army Corps of Engineers were allowed to skip repairs and get right to upgrading and expanding the bunker complex. Equipment all over the Enclave were brought in and an expansion to the bunker was made, having so that the complex covered Hidden Valley, allowing for more room when it came to the base’s garrison and robotic units. Along with the expansion came multiple hangers for vertibirds and garages for ground vehicles; with the ground vehicles being able to reach the surface thanks to large tunnels and lifts built around the area connecting to the complex.\n\nHidden Valley also connected to Nellis Air Force Base, making sure that it can easily contact additional air support when it came to reinforcing the Enclave’s law in the Mojave and deal with any rebels on the region.

purists_ead_nevada.9.d: "After rejecting Wagner’s idea, we went with the first plan, Thanks to the many vents that lead down into the bunker, we are given easy access to the ventilation system of the bunker. After a quick supply drop, our troops unleashed The Cloud into the bunker, and after the cloud they dropped in a few robo-scorpions with cameras transmitting to our teams outside.\n\nThe robo-scorpions crawled and snuck through the base as the toxin did its work, poisoning the traitors when they least expected it, they could do nothing as they slowly died inside their home.

purists_ead_nevada.10.d: "Within the ruins of New Reno lay an old factory guarded by high end robots, turrets, and partially picked clean by scavengers and New Reno Gangs. However, inside lay the factory workings of US Ordnance, a pre-War weapons manufacturer. While it never grew as large as the likes of Stent Security or West Tek, it was a modest company that focused in the Nevada area. Post War saw the Factory locked down, only to open to the authorities. And that authority happens to be the US Government. Inside we’ve found the factory to be relatively intact, and with a few simple repairs can be returned to full working order, producing weapons and material for our growing Army!"

However, 200 years of lack of upkeep and maintenance have let it fall into disarray. The gangs of New Reno never ventured to restart the project, lest they be targeted by rivals. Now that law and order has been restored, the Enclave has managed to get the project running at near full capacity again. While it’s no Helios One, the project is more than capable of power our military assets for the time being."

Spurred by the Legend of the Star Bottlecaps, several of our soldiers raided the former soft drink maker’s headquarters in Southend, and while all they discovered was a busted robot, a dead man, and a bunch of toy deputy badges, the machinery is intact, and only needs a few repairs to get running again! What’s more, the formula is still intact in the Companies servers, allowing us to restart the drink as a Nevada exclusive and a competitor to Nuka Cola!"

It's our great luck that the USGS Office in New Reno was left alone by scavengers and wastelanders since no one exactly found water at this location. Instead, the real prize are the data sensors and research logs that pinpoint the aquifers that have been replenished over the past couple of centuries. Thanks to the low fallout in this area, they are likely to not be ‘as’ tainted as some other areas. "

purists_ead_nevada.17.d: "In our current situation we live under the watch of The NCR, Rangers and spies being sent in trying to figure out who we are. We have to constantly shake them off by toning down our operations, the more we grow the more The NCR investigates us. Once we start implementing certain policies, like that of slavery, The NCR will be on us. But thankfully an answer has come from that of Colonel Frank Wagner. He has argued that we could hide many of our operations under the guise of Vault City. A lie that could work, having some vault city personnel that we brought brought in be sent into the NCR as ambassadors. Whilst it is a disgusting idea to discuss with inhumans, it could easily buy us time and have the NCR lose our scent. Though of course saying we’re Vault City wouldn’t do much if Rangers still reported Enclave iconography and gear around Nevada, so we would have to go further.\n\nIf we go with Wagner's plan, we would also have to make sure that everything in plain view could be mistaken for Vault City iconography and equipment. Guards wearing Vault Security armor, power armor being limited, etc. It would be a costly change to keep ourselves hidden, but it’s better than having our cover blown far before we’re ready. That is of course, The NCR doesn’t tumble their way into us in their endless greed."
